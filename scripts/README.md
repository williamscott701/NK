## Removed Scripts

The following scripts were removed as they were one-time fixes and no longer needed:

- **Bible Order Scripts**: All chronological and canonical order scripts were one-time fixes
- **Analysis Scripts**: Order verification and analysis scripts were one-time tasks

The Bible book ordering has been completed and these maintenance scripts are no longer required for ongoing development.
